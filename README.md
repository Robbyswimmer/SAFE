# SAFE: Selectively Augmenting Frozen Encoders
## Adding Audio to VL Models with Zero Regression & Efficiency Gains

---

**SAFE** is a research framework for safely adding audio capabilities to production Vision-Language (VL) models without compromising existing performance. The framework addresses the critical challenge of capability expansion in deployed multimodal systems where regression risks are unacceptable.

## Research Problem

Production VL models (BLIP-2, LLaVA) lack audio understanding, but traditional approaches to adding new modalities require full model retraining, creating significant regression risks for deployed systems. SAFE provides a principled solution through architectural innovations and training methodologies designed for safe capability expansion.

## Key Innovations

- **Zero Regression Architecture**: Gated bypass mechanism with mathematical guarantees for preserving base VL performance
- **Efficiency-Aware Design**: Learned policy for selective audio processing with substantial computational savings
- **Safety-First Training**: Multi-stage curriculum with retention constraints and validation protocols
- **Modular Implementation**: Clean separation enabling easy integration with existing VL architectures

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/safe
cd safe

# Create virtual environment (Python 3.11 recommended)
python3.11 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install SAFE package in development mode
pip install -e .
```

### Basic Usage

```python
import torch
from safe.models.projectors import AudioProjector
from safe.models.fusion_adapter import CrossAttentionBlock
from safe.rl.policy import AudioPolicyNetwork

# Create audio projector
projector = AudioProjector(
    audio_embed_dim=512,      # CLAP embedding dimension
    llm_hidden_size=768,      # LLM hidden dimension  
    num_audio_tokens=8        # Audio tokens to generate
)

# Create fusion adapter
fusion = CrossAttentionBlock(
    hidden_size=768,
    num_attention_heads=12
)

# Create RL policy
policy = AudioPolicyNetwork(
    state_feature_dim=256,
    token_budgets=[0, 4, 8, 12]  # Token budget options
)

# Process audio features
audio_features = torch.randn(2, 512)  # Batch of CLAP features
audio_tokens = projector(audio_features)

# Fuse with LLM hidden states
llm_states = torch.randn(2, 10, 768)
fused_states = fusion(llm_states, audio_tokens)

# Get policy decisions
state_features = torch.randn(2, 256)
actions = policy.get_actions(state_features)
```

## Training Methodology

SAFE employs a principled 3-stage training curriculum designed to ensure safe capability expansion:

### Stage A: Foundation Training
- **Objective**: Establish audio-text-vision alignment while preserving base VL capabilities
- **Approach**: Balanced training on audio-dependent and VL-only tasks with retention constraints
- **Safety Measures**: KL distillation and Fisher regularization to prevent performance degradation

```python
from safe.training.stage_a import StageATrainer

trainer = StageATrainer(
    safe_model=model,
    train_dataloader=train_loader,
    val_dataloader=val_loader,
    config={
        "learning_rate_projector": 1e-4,
        "learning_rate_adapter": 5e-5,
        "retention_tolerance": 0.005  # 0.5% VL degradation limit
    }
)
trainer.train()
```

### Stage B: Efficiency Optimization
- **Objective**: Learn selective audio processing for computational efficiency
- **Method**: Policy learning with multi-objective optimization
- **Focus**: Balance between performance gains and computational cost

### Stage C: Deployment Preparation
- **Objective**: Optimize for production deployment
- **Method**: Policy distillation and lightweight gating mechanisms
- **Goal**: Maintain research capabilities in efficient deployment-ready form

## Research Objectives

| Dimension | Goal | Rationale |
