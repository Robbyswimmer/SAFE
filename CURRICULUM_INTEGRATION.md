## 🚀 Usage Examples

### **With Curriculum Learning (Recommended):**

```python
from safe.training.stage_a import StageATrainer

# Initialize trainer with curriculum
trainer = StageATrainer(
    safe_model=model,
    train_dataloader=train_loader,
    val_dataloader=val_loader,
    config=training_config,
    curriculum_config="configs/curriculum/default_curriculum.yaml"  # Enable curriculum
)

# Train with automatic stage progression
final_metrics = trainer.train()
```

### **Traditional Training (Fallback):**

```python
# Initialize trainer without curriculum
trainer = StageATrainer(
    safe_model=model,
    train_dataloader=train_loader,
    val_dataloader=val_loader,
    config=training_config,
    curriculum_config=None  # Disable curriculum
)

# Train for fixed epochs
final_metrics = trainer.train()
```

### **Command Line Usage:**

```bash
# With curriculum learning
python train_stage_a_curriculum.py --config demo --curriculum configs/curriculum/default_curriculum.yaml

# Traditional training
python train_stage_a_curriculum.py --config demo --no-curriculum --epochs 10
```

## 🔧 Key Features Implemented

### **1. Automatic Stage Progression**
- **Criteria-based advancement**: Automatic progression when performance thresholds are met
- **Stage extension**: Automatic extension when criteria are not met (up to configurable limits)
- **Early progression**: Fast-track advancement when performance significantly exceeds requirements
- **Failure handling**: Graceful termination if criteria cannot be met after extensions

### **2. Dynamic Configuration Updates**
- **Loss weight adaptation**: Per-stage loss function weight adjustments
- **Learning rate scheduling**: Stage-specific learning rate multipliers
- **Audio ratio adjustment**: Progressive increase in audio-dependent sample ratios
- **Difficulty filtering**: Stage-appropriate sample complexity selection

### **3. Enhanced Monitoring and Logging**
- **Stage context**: All logs include current curriculum stage information
- **Progress tracking**: Detailed progress reports with stage completion status
- **Metrics correlation**: Curriculum metrics integrated with standard training metrics
- **Checkpoint management**: Stage-specific checkpoint saving and curriculum state persistence

### **4. Comprehensive Testing Integration**
- **Mock dataset support**: Full integration with curriculum-aware test datasets
- **Validation framework**: Compatible with dataset quality validation
- **Performance testing**: Integrated performance monitoring and regression detection
- **CI/CD ready**: Automated testing pipeline support
