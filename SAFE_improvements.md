## Red Flags to Watch For

As you run experiments, watch for these warning signs:

🚩 **Audio doesn't help**: If audio gains <2-3%, reconsider whole approach
🚩 **VL degrades >1%**: Retention strategy failing, need to investigate
🚩 **High variance**: If results vary wildly across seeds, something's wrong
🚩 **Training instability**: Loss spikes, NaN gradients indicate numerical issues
🚩 **Dataset quality issues**: High proportion of failed audio downloads

## Notes

- **Don't feel pressure to complete everything** - Prioritize based on your timeline
- **Honest negative results are publishable** - If audio doesn't help much, that's still a valid finding
- **Workshop first is smart** - Get early feedback before investing in full implementation
- **Quality over quantity** - Better to have fewer, rigorous experiments than many sloppy ones

Good luck!
